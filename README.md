# KNN Classification for Gene Expression Data

This project explores the use of the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm for classifying gene expression data. 
The notebook provides a step-by-step approach to preprocessing, visualizing, and modeling the data, leveraging scikit-learn for machine learning workflows.

## Features
- **Data Exploration**: Visualizing gene expression relationships and class distributions.
- **Preprocessing**: Scaling features and splitting data into training and test sets.
- **Model Training**: Building a KNN classifier and evaluating its performance.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing the number of neighbors using GridSearchCV.
- **Pipelines**: Streamlining the workflow with scikit-learn pipelines.

## Files
- `KNN-Classification-for-gene-expression-data.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the entire workflow.
